# KeytarHero ðŸŽ¸

## Description
This is a project to create a working device similar to the guitar used in the Guitar Hero and Rock Band Games. It was originally designed with the game Clone Hero in mind, which can be downloaded at clonehero.net/ \n
The current iterration uses a Teensy 2.0 microcontroller as the brain of the device, with the code written primarily in the Arduino IDE. 5 Cherry MX blue switches are wired to the Teensy, as well as a Joystick module. \n

## Tasks
- Modify Arduino Code to include more buttons for the guitar (look at Clone Hero button layout for reference)
- Design prototype PCBs to mount Teensy, switches, and joystick
- Design prototype guitar to mount PCBs to
- Create working C/C++ equivalent of the Arduino code (optional)
